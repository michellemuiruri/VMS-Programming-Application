I would go into the group policies and see what settings are preventing the files from being shared. Some obstacles I would have to overcome would vary from access as well as talking to users and getting all the required information to come to a proper solution. The technologies I would use would probably be Active directory for the policies as well as checking the servers to see how the files can be shared.
